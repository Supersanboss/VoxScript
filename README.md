 ## Welcome to VoxScript!
 VoxScript — when used in a context that supports Gemini’s TTS — is a tool that converts written text into spoken audio using high‑quality, neural, humanlike voices. Gemini‑TTS supports multiple “voice presets” (names like Zephyr, Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir, etc.) to give users a wide palette of vocal styles (bright, upbeat, firm, warm, soft, etc.).
Unlike traditional robotic TTS, Gemini‑TTS (and thus VoxScript when properly integrated) generates speech with natural intonation, pacing, and emotional nuance. Because of that, the output can feel close to a live narrator — useful for narration, audiobooks, tutorials, or creative content.


## Key Features (as enabled by Gemini + VoxScript)

1. Multiple voices with distinct personalities/timbres — Users can choose from many voice presets (bright, airy, firm, soft, mature, youthful, etc.) to match the tone of the content.
2. Control over style and delivery — Through natural‑language configuration (prompting style, tone, speed, emotion) you can steer the voice to speak happily, seriously, softly, dramatically, etc.
3. Single‑speaker or multi‑speaker output — You can generate audio with one voice or assign different voices to different “speakers,” enabling dialogues or multi‑voice narration.
4. Support for many languages — Gemini‑TTS supports a broad set of languages, so VoxScript doesn’t have to be limited to English text.
5. Flexible input/output — Whether you’re converting a paragraph, a full article, a script, or a dialogue — you can feed the text to VoxScript/Gemini TTS and get back a downloadable audio file.
